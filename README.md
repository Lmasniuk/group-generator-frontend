## Functional Requirements

-   Upload a .csv file with student names and grades
    -   The .csv file will have N lines where N is the number of students
    -   Each line of the .csv file will have a student name, then a grade represented as a number with no percent sign
-   Upload button allows you to select a .csv file
-   Allow the user to input the allowed deviation from the grade average of the class
    -   ex) If the avg is 85%, an allowed deviation of 4% would allow groups with an average grade in the range of 81% - 89%.
-   Allow the user to input the max group size, where groups will be either the max size or 1 less than the max size.
-   Information on the page that indicates how the groupings are made
